The proxy situation on Android is [an
embarrasment](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1273).  It's
scarcely credible, but Android didn't have a global proxy setting at all until
quite recently, and it's still not supported on many common Android versions.
In the meantime the app ecosystem has grown used to life without this basic
necessity, and many apps merrily ignore it even if it's there. This situation
is improving, but in many circumstances using [transparent
mode](@!urlTo("transparent.html")!@) is mandatory for testing Android apps.

We used both an Asus Transformer Prime TF201 (Android 4.0.3) and a Nexus 4
(Android 4.4.4) in the examples below - your device may differ, but the broad
process should be similar.  On **emulated devices**, there are some [additional
quirks](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/204#issuecomment-32837093)
to consider.


## Getting the certificate onto the device

The easiest way to get the certificate to the device is to use [the web
app](@!urlTo("webapp.html")!@). In the rare cases where the web app doesn't
work, you will need to get the __mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer__ file into the
__/sdcard__ folder on the device (/sdcard/Download on older devices). This can
be accomplished in a number of ways:

- If you have the Android Developer Tools installed, you can use [__adb
push__](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html).
- Using a file transfer program like wget (installed on the Android device) to
copy the file over.
- Transfer the file using external media like an SD Card. 

Once we have the certificate on the local disk, we need to import it into the
list of trusted CAs. Go to Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Credential Storage,
and select "Install from storage":

The certificate in /sdcard is automatically located and offered for
installation. Installing the cert will delete the download file from the local
disk.


## Installing the certificate

You should now see something like this (you may have to explicitly name the
certificate):

<img src="android-settingssecurityinstallca.png"/>

Click OK, and you should then see the certificate listed in the Trusted
Credentials store:
