## Getting the certificate onto the device

The easiest way to get the certificate to the device is to use [the web
app](@!urlTo("webapp.html")!@). In the rare cases where the web app doesn't
work, you will need to get the __mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem__ file to the device to
install it. The easiest way to accomplish this is to set up the Mail app on the
device, and to email it over as an attachment. Open the email, tap on the
attachment, then proceed with the install.


## Installing the certificate

<ol class="tlist">
    <li>You will be prompted to install a profile. Click "Install":

    <img src="@!urlTo('ios-profile.png')!@"/></li>

    <li>Accept the warning by clicking "Install" again:

    <img src="@!urlTo('ios-warning.png')!@"/></li>

    <li>The certificate should now be trusted:

    <img src="@!urlTo('ios-installed.png')!@"/></li>

</ol>
